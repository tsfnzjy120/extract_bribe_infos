- This project is supporting data and program for published papers. 
- Actually it is not a perfect program, and I would update it occasionally. In the process of improvement, some codes and documents might be inconsistent which doesn't affect normal usage. **Recent Status: Imperfect**
- To run this program, you need:
    - [x] Download data from: [click me](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1avPAZ78Ku9CsM4re4Q1bCw) (password: eajx)
    - [x] Install python-package: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - [x] Alter several file paths
- For any question, mail to tsfnzjy120@ruc.edu.cn
